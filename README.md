# memcached-stat

Inspired by (junegunn's redis-stat)[https://github.com/junegunn/redis-stat] project, I decide to build one for memcached. I know there are quite a few tools out there with similar features. But I decide to (partially) re-invent the wheel since I did not find anyone similar to that `redis-stat` tool.

This project is under development. Currently it only has a commandline bare bone. I don't know when I can implement the web-based GUI functions. Let me know if you have any questions or comments.
